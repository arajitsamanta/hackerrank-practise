// Function to calculate maximum profit by buying and selling a stock from an array of stock prices for a day.
// The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30 am local time.
// The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of certain stock at that time.So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am,
// that means stockPrices[60] = 500.
// Constraint - You need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can't buy and sell in the same time stepâ€”at least 1 minute has to pass.
// Runtime Complexity - TIme: O(n), Space: O(1)
